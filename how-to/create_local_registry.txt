You can start your own local registry it with some docker commands, like:

docker volume create local_registry
docker container run -d --name registry.localhost -v local_registry:/var/lib/registry --restart always -p 12345:5000 registry:2

These commands will start your registry container with name and port (on your host) registry.localhost:12345. In order to push to this registry, you will need to make it accessible as described in the next section.
Once your registry is up and running, we will need to add it to your registries.yaml configuration file.
Finally, you have to connect the registry network to the k3d cluster network: 

docker network connect k3d-k3s-default registry.localhost.
